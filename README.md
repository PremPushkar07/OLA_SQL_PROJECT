# Ola Ride Analytics ‚Äî SQL Case Study Project

Welcome to the Ola Ride Analytics project ‚Äî
a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of ride-sharing operations,
customer behavior, and business performance using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. 
This project is designed to  showcase my SQL skills, and deliver real-world insights from a dataset.

---

# Project Objective

This project aims to:
- Analyze ride performance across vehicle types and locations
- Understand customer & driver behavior trends
- Monitor operational efficiency (VTAT, CTAT)
- Deliver business-impacting insights using 30 structured SQL queries
