# Ola Ride Analytics — SQL Case Study Project

Welcome to the Ola Ride Analytics project —
a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of ride-sharing operations,
customer behavior, and business performance using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. 
This project is designed to  showcase my SQL skills, and deliver real-world insights from a dataset.

---

 Objective
Analyze operational metrics,
customer behavior, ride patterns, revenue drivers, and cancellations
using structured SQL queries. 
Draw actionable insights to support business decisions for a ride-hailing platform.
